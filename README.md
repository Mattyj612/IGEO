# Welcome To IGEO

At NYU's [Lab for the Developing Mind](https://www.labdevelopingmind.com/), we devise experiments to explore the development of geometric intuitions. In this particular task, we ask infants, children, and adults to determine whether a path connecting two points on a sphere or a plane is the most efficient path between those points.

The project is worked on by Matthew Jordan, Yuval Hart, Nicole Loncar, Holly Huey, and Moira R. Dillon (PI).
